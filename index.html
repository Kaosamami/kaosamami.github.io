<h1> Weezy: his Royal Fluffiness </h1>
<p> The biography of Weezy the 1st</p>
<h2> Life </h2>
<p> Weezy was born sometime around June 2011 in the south-west of France. 
    As a young kitten, his favorite pastime was to destroy the plants of the neighbor and play with his brother.
After being adopted by his new family (soon-to-be servants), the first thing he did was falling into the fireplace vent and gave them quite the scare.
But he quickly found his marks and started enjoying his new pastime: bitting feet.   </p>

<p> As a 11 year-old fluffy cat, Weezy enjoy his days comfortably with his servants to answer his every need.
    He starts every day with a petting session and a patrol of his territory.
Then, he goes back to sleep until dinner time. Sometimes, he'll bring back a bird of a mouse because his hoomans are <cite>"very bad at hutting".</cite> </p>
